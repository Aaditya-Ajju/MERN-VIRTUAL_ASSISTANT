# Virtual Assistant (Voice AI)

A full-stack voice-enabled virtual assistant web app using React (Vite) for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend. The assistant can answer questions, open Google/YouTube/Facebook/Instagram/Calculator/Weather, and more, using natural language voice commands.

---

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** Speak naturally to the assistant; it listens and responds.
- **Custom Greeting:** Greets the user on page load and starts listening automatically.
- **Google Search:** For any general question (e.g., "Who is Virat Kohli?"), the assistant says "Searching it on Google" and opens the Google search results in a new tab.
- **YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Calculator, Weather:**
  - Commands like "open YouTube", "play [song] on YouTube", "open Facebook", etc., open the relevant site in a new tab and speak a short response.
- **No Looping:** Robust logic prevents the assistant from listening to its own voice and getting stuck in a loop.
- **Simple, Clean UI:** Shows assistant image, name, and clear listening/speaking indicators.
- **Authentication & Customization:** User signup/signin, and assistant customization (name, image).
- **History:** View your previous queries in the sidebar.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Setup the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URL="<your-mongodb-connection-string>"
JWT_SECRET="<your-jwt-secret>"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>'
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='<your-cloudinary-api-key>'
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='<your-cloudinary-api-secret>'
GEMINI_API_URL="<your-gemini-api-url>"
```

#### Start the backend:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
node index.js
```

### 3. Setup the Frontend
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The frontend will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- The backend will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
